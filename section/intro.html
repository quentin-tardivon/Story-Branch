          <p>The Hundred Years War is a conflict that lasted more than 100 years (116 to be exact), from 1337 to 1453, between England and France.
          This war was due to two things ; firstly, the status of the duchy of Guyenne (Aquitaine), because even though it belonged to the kings of England, it remained a fief of the French crown, and secondly, the kings of England from 1337 claimed the crown of France.</p>

          <p>You are going to play the entire war as the kings of England. The goal is to stick as possible to reality - you'll see how far or close at the end of the game.
          Don't forget that reality sometimes superseedes fiction !</p>
