# English Project: Historical Game

## Requirements:

Electron based application (multiplatform and web powered)

## Game Idea:

Historical based game in which you must try to reproduce what really happened as
an english ruler during medieval times. Your score is determined by how closely
your decisions matched with reality.

## Roadmap:

1. Beginning with the script, choose a time-period.
2. Learn plain javascript (and beginning Electron)
3. Develop basic text-based application in plain JS.
4. Create graphics (inspiration from Github Trees, MiniMetro and Reigns graphic style)
5. Integrate the whole project in Electron based app.

## Improvements:

* Scores (multiplayer)
* Create save
* Save result as an external file (png, jpeg, pdf)
