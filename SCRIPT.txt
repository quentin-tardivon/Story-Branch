Beginning : Hundred Years War

Introduction : 

/* The Hundred Years War is a conflit that lasted more than 100 years (116 to be exact), from 1337 to 1453, between England and France.
This war was due to two things ; firstly, the status of the duchy of Guyenne (Aquitaine), because even though it belonged to the kings of England, it remained a fief of the French crown, and secondly, the kings of England from 1337 claimed the crown of France.

You are going to play the entire war as the kings of England. The goal is to stick as possible to reality - you'll see how far or close at the end of the game. 
Don't forget that reality sometimes superseedes fiction !
